    <p>Red colobuses are Old World monkeys of the genus Piliocolobus.[2] <br> It was formerly considered a subgenus within the genus Procolobus, which is now restricted to the olive colobus.[1] They are closely related to the black-and-white colobus monkeys (genus Colobus), and some species are often found in groups with the blue monkey.[3] <br> western red colobus is frequently hunted by the common chimpanzee</p>

    <p>The members of this genus are found in western, central and eastern Africa, and the species have largely allo- or parapatric<br> distributions. They are primarily arboreal and most are restricted to humid forests, <br>  the Zanzibar red colobus prefers coastal thickets and scrub. Red colobuses are highly sensitive to hunting and habitat destruction, and have been referred to as probably the most threatened taxonomic group of primates in Africa</p>
